# Image Format Comparison

This document provides an overview of the image formats supported by the Multi-Format Image Converter and their characteristics.

## WebP

**Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari 14+, Opera

**Characteristics**:
- Developed by Google
- Excellent compression with minimal quality loss
- Supports both lossy and lossless compression
- Supports transparency (alpha channel)
- Typically 25-35% smaller than PNG and 25-34% smaller than JPEG at equivalent visual quality
- Supports animation (not currently implemented in our converter)

**Best For**:
- Web graphics requiring transparency
- Photos where file size is a priority
- Replacing both JPEG and PNG files on modern websites

**Options in Converter**:
- Quality slider (for lossy mode)
- Lossless toggle
- Alpha channel toggle

## JPEG

**Browser Compatibility**: Universal support

**Characteristics**:
- Lossy compression optimized for photographs
- No support for transparency
- Can achieve high compression ratios with gradual quality degradation
- Widely used and recognized format
- Progressive loading option allows for incremental display during download

**Best For**:
- Photographs and complex images with smooth color variations
- When transparency is not needed
- When universal compatibility is required

**Options in Converter**:
- Quality slider
- Progressive loading option

## PNG

**Browser Compatibility**: Universal support

**Characteristics**:
- Lossless compression
- Excellent for images with sharp edges, text, and solid colors
- Supports transparency (alpha channel)
- Larger file sizes than lossy formats
- Different compression levels affect only file size, not image quality

**Best For**:
- Images with text, line art, or sharp edges
- Images requiring transparency
- When lossless quality is essential

**Options in Converter**:
- Compression level (0-9)

## GIF

**Browser Compatibility**: Universal support

**Characteristics**:
- Limited to 256 colors
- Lossless compression for each frame
- Supports simple transparency (binary - either fully transparent or fully opaque)
- Supports animation (not currently implemented in our converter)
- Indexed color mode results in significant color banding for photographs

**Best For**:
- Simple animations
- Images with limited colors
- Simple graphics with solid colors

**Options in Converter**:
- Basic conversion only (limited options due to format constraints)

## AVIF

**Browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari 16+, Opera (not supported in older browsers)

**Characteristics**:
- Newest format based on AV1 video codec
- Superior compression compared to all other formats
- Supports both lossy and lossless compression
- Supports high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut
- Supports transparency
- Can require more processing power to encode/decode

**Best For**:
- Next-generation web imagery
- When targeting modern browsers
- Maximum file size savings without quality loss

**Options in Converter**:
- Quality slider (for lossy mode)
- Low data mode (for faster decoding)

## Compression Comparison (Approximate)

For a typical photograph at visually similar quality:

| Format | Relative File Size | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| PNG    | 100% (baseline)   | Lossless |
| JPEG   | 30-40%            | Lossy, no transparency |
| WebP   | 20-30%            | Lossy, with transparency |
| AVIF   | 15-20%            | Lossy, with transparency |
| GIF    | 70-90%            | Limited to 256 colors |

Note: Actual compression results vary greatly depending on image content, quality settings, and specific implementation.
