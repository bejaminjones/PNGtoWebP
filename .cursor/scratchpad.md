# Multi-Format Image Converter Project

## Background and Motivation
The Multi-Format Image Converter is a web application designed to convert images between various formats. It started as a simple PNG to WebP converter and has evolved into a comprehensive multi-format conversion tool with advanced features. The application runs entirely in the browser, leveraging modern web technologies to provide a fast and user-friendly experience without requiring server-side processing.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The project provides client-side image conversion using browser capabilities, which brings browser compatibility challenges
- The application needs to handle various image formats with different options and settings
- User experience considerations include progress tracking, error handling, and optimization options
- File management for handling multiple conversions simultaneously

## High-level Task Breakdown
Based on the initial code review, the project appears to have already implemented:
1. Multiple format conversion support (PNG, WebP, JPEG, GIF, AVIF)
2. Advanced conversion options (quality settings, lossless conversion, resize capabilities)
3. Dark/light theme support
4. Browser compatibility detection
5. Batch processing with concurrent conversion (max 3 files at once)
6. Progress indicators with percentage display
7. Error handling with retry capability
8. File size optimization feature
9. Before/after thumbnail comparisons

## Project Status Board
- [x] Expanded File Format Support - Added support for multiple input/output formats
- [x] Enhanced User Interface - Implemented modern UI with dark mode
- [x] Added Image Preview Functionality - Including before/after comparison
- [x] Implemented Advanced Conversion Options - Added resize functionality and format-specific options
- [x] Improved Conversion Process - Added progress indicators and batch processing
- [x] Added Individual Download Options - Allow downloading individual files 
- [x] Implemented File Size Optimization - Added target file size option
- [x] Added Browser Compatibility Check - Detect browser support for formats

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
The project appears to be feature complete. The application provides a comprehensive set of tools for image conversion with excellent user feedback and control options.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
No current assistance requests. Initial code review completed.

## Lessons
- Browser compatibility varies for different image formats, especially for newer formats like AVIF
- Quality settings need to be format-specific as they apply differently to various formats
- Concurrent processing needs careful management to avoid performance issues
