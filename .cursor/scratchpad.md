# Multi-Format Image Converter Enhancement Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current PNG to WebP converter is a simple web application that allows users to convert PNG images to WebP format with adjustable quality settings. WebP is a modern image format that provides superior compression while maintaining quality, which makes it ideal for web usage. Our goal is to enhance this converter into a comprehensive image format conversion tool that supports multiple input and output formats, making it more useful, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The current application only supports PNG to WebP conversion
- It lacks support for other source formats (JPEG, GIF, etc.) and target formats
- There's limited feedback during the conversion process
- Image preview functionality is missing
- No advanced options for image conversion are available
- The UI could be improved for better user experience

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Expand File Format Support**
   - Add support for converting JPEG, GIF, and other formats to WebP
   - Add support for converting to other output formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, AVIF)
   - Implement a format selection matrix (input format → output format)
   - Success criteria: The application can accept multiple input formats and convert to multiple output formats

2. **Enhance User Interface**
   - Implement a more modern and responsive UI design
   - Add dark mode support
   - Improve drag and drop visual feedback
   - Success criteria: UI looks more professional and provides better visual feedback

3. **Add Image Preview Functionality**
   - Show thumbnails of uploaded images
   - Add before/after comparison view
   - Success criteria: Users can preview both original and converted images

4. **Implement Advanced Conversion Options**
   - Add lossless conversion option for supported formats
   - Add resize functionality
   - Add metadata preservation options
   - Add format-specific options for each output format
   - Success criteria: Users can adjust format-specific settings for each conversion type

5. **Improve Conversion Process**
   - Add better progress indicators
   - Implement batch processing optimizations
   - Add detailed conversion statistics (size reduction, etc.)
   - Success criteria: Conversion process provides real-time feedback and statistics

6. **Add Individual Download Options**
   - Allow downloading individual converted files in addition to the zip
   - Success criteria: Individual download buttons appear next to each converted file

7. **Implement File Size Optimization Options**
   - Add target file size option
   - Add automatic quality adjustment to meet size targets
   - Success criteria: Users can set target file sizes and the app automatically adjusts quality

8. **Add Browser Compatibility Check**
   - Detect if the user's browser supports various image formats (WebP, AVIF, etc.)
   - Provide alternative format suggestions based on browser support
   - Success criteria: The app notifies users of format compatibility issues and offers alternatives

- [ ] 5. Improve Conversion Process
- [ ] 6. Add Individual Download Options
- [ ] 7. Implement File Size Optimization Options
- [ ] 8. Add Browser Compatibility Check

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Task 1 - Expand File Format Support** ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented support for all image formats as input (using image/* accept attribute)
- Added dropdown to select output format (WebP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, AVIF)
- Created lossless conversion option
- Added format-specific handling for quality settings
- Implemented automatic file extension handling for all formats
- Updated UI to reflect multi-format capabilities

Ready to move on to the next task.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I have completed Task 1 (Expand File Format Support). The main changes include:

1. Renamed the application to "Multi-Format Image Converter"
2. Added support for all image formats as input
3. Implemented output format selection (WebP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, AVIF)
4. Added a lossless conversion option that disables quality settings for lossless formats
5. Dynamically shows/hides quality slider based on format selection
6. Improved error handling for unsupported formats

The app now accepts any image format as input and can convert to any of the specified output formats. The quality slider dynamically appears only for formats that support quality adjustment (JPEG, WebP, AVIF), and is hidden for lossless formats or when the lossless checkbox is checked.

Would you like me to move on to Task 2 (Enhance User Interface) next?

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
- Always ask before using the -force git command.
