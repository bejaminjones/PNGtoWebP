# Multi-Format Image Converter Project

## Background and Motivation
The Multi-Format Image Converter is a web application designed to convert images between various formats. It started as a simple PNG to WebP converter and has evolved into a comprehensive multi-format conversion tool with advanced features. The application runs entirely in the browser, leveraging modern web technologies to provide a fast and user-friendly experience without requiring server-side processing.

Currently, the application has been modularized from its original structure as a single HTML file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This improves maintainability, readability, and future extensibility.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The project provides client-side image conversion using browser capabilities, which brings browser compatibility challenges for some formats (especially WebP and AVIF)
- The user interface needs to be responsive and intuitive, handling drag-and-drop functionality and providing visual feedback during conversion
- The conversion process needs to be efficient and handle various image formats and options
- CSS and JavaScript need proper organization to improve maintainability and readability

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. ✅ Create a sensible directory structure
   - Success criteria: Directory structure established with CSS, JS, and assets folders
   
2. ✅ Extract CSS to separate files
   - Success criteria: All CSS moved from inline to external files, organized by functionality
   
3. ✅ Modularize JavaScript
   - Success criteria: JavaScript code moved from inline to separate files, organized by responsibility
   
4. ✅ Create documentation
   - Success criteria: README file created with project info and usage instructions

## Project Status Board
- [x] Create directory structure for CSS, JS, and assets
- [x] Extract theme-related CSS to themes.css
- [x] Extract global styles to main.css
- [x] Extract component-specific CSS to component files
- [x] Extract utility classes to utilities.css
- [x] Create utility JS modules (formats.js, ui.js, fileUtils.js)
- [x] Create component JS modules (themeManager.js, dropZone.js, fileList.js, controls.js)
- [x] Create service JS modules (compatCheck.js, converter.js, storage.js)
- [x] Create main.js entry point
- [x] Update HTML to reference the new external files
- [x] Create README with project description and instructions

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
All planned tasks have been completed successfully. The application has been fully modularized with:

- CSS files organized by functionality (themes, main styles, utilities, component-specific styles)
- JavaScript organized into modules (components, services, utilities)
- HTML updated to reference the external files
- Documentation added to describe the project and its structure

The application now has a much more maintainable structure while maintaining all its original functionality.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Task completion was successful without major issues. The application is now structured in a modular way that will make future maintenance and extensions much easier.

## Lessons
- When modularizing a complex web application, keeping clear module boundaries with defined responsibilities helps maintain a clean architecture
- Organizing code by functionality rather than by file type makes navigation and maintenance easier
- Including comprehensive documentation helps onboard new developers to the project
